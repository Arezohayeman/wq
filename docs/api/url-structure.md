The wq URL Structure
====================

This page will document and justify the URL structure generated by the URL router in [wq.db]'s [app.py] and consumed by the URL router in [wq.app]'s [wq/app.js].  To promote interoperability, this structure will be specified here independently of the implementations in wq.app and wq.db.  The ultimate goal is to make it possible for either (or both?) of wq.db and wq.app to be exchanged for another architecture as long as the following structure is maintained for communication between them.

This doc page is still a WIP.  To be discussed:
 * `GET/POST/PUT /[url].[format]`
   * `.html` (default)
   * `.json`
   * `.geojson`
   * `.js`
 * `GET /[list]`
 * `GET /[list]?page=2`
 * `GET /[list]/new`
 * `POST /[list]`
 * `GET /[list]/[id]`
 * `GET /[list]/[id]/[edit]`
 * `PUT /[list]/[id]`
 * `GET /[other]`
 * `POST /[other]`
 * `GET /config` - The auto-generated [config] object; explain why this is not at root

Optional extensions:

 * `GET /` (Special case for list at root)
 * `GET /[id]` (Special case for list item at root)
 * `GET /` (Special case for other at root)
 * `GET /[parent_list]/[id]/[list]`
 * `GET /[list]-by-[parent_list]`
