wq Configuration Object
=======================

The wq Configuration object is a JSON structure that describes the [URL structure] of a website (/web app) *and* its corresponding REST API.  It assumes the website and the API share the same URL structure; see [My Website is its own REST API] for the motivation behind this approach.  The configuration object is typically generated by a REST service (e.g. [wq.db]) and provided to a JavaScript client (e.g. [wq.app]) in order to set common expectations on the layout of the application.

The basic format of the wq Configuration Object is:

```javascript
{
    'pages': {
        '[model_name]': {'list': true, 'url': '[model_name]s', 'form': [...]},
        '[simple_page]': {'url': '[simple_page]'}
    }
}
```

The object is typically made available as `config.json` at the top level of the REST [URL structure].

> **Implementation Note**: If you are using [wq.db], a configuration object will automatically be generated by the default [router] based on Django models registered with [wq.db.rest].  If you need to customize an entry in the wq.db-generated `pages` configuration, you should generally do so by supplying additional arguments to  [router.register_model][wq.db.rest] - otherwise the server and client configurations may be out of sync.  The information below is primarily for those interested in fine-tuning the individual settings, and for those using [wq/app.js] without [wq.db].

## Configuration Options
The primary configuration section in the wq configuration object is `pages`, which contains detailed information about the [URL structure] of the application.  For example, the `pages` configuration is used by [wq/app.js] to map URL requests to page templates to render, and also to provide hints to [wq/store.js] and [wq/model.js] as to the structure of the REST API containing the actual data.

As its name implies, the `pages` section summarizes all of the available "pages" in the application.  The section is a mapping of page "names" to simple configuration objects describing each respective page.  Pages fall into two categories depending on whether or not they are backed by a database table (i.e. ORM model in a Django application).

 * Pages backed by a database table are indicated with `"list": true`.  The name of these pages is the name of the underlying database model.  Marking a page as `"list": true` implies the presence of list, detail, and edit views for a database entity - all with [corresponding URLs] defined relative to the `url` property defined for the page.

 * Pages without a corresponding model do not have the `list` property set, and have only a single URL which is specified by the `url` property.  By convention, the name of these pages is usually the same as the URL.

The full listing of page configuration options is described below.

### General Options

 Name | Usage
------|-------
`list` | Boolean.  Sets whether or this is a *list* page or a *simple* page.  If true, it is assumed that there will be a set of [templates] named `[model_name]_list`, `[model_name]_detail`, and optionally `[model_name]_edit`.  If false or unset, it is assumed that there will be a single template with the same name as the page.
`url` | The URL of the page.  For simple pages, this is conventionally the same as the name of the page.  For list views, it is typically the verbose plural name of the model (without spaces).  The list view will be rendered at `[url]/`, while detail and edit views will be constructed from this value as `[url]/[item_id]` and `[url]/[item_id]/edit`, respectively.
`once` | Whether to only render this page once or every time it is opened during a browsing session.  The default is false (render every time), which is usually acceptable and is the recommended setting for list pages.  The primary use for this value is with simple pages such as overview maps. Setting `once` to true in this case means that the user can browse around the application then come back to the overview map and find it in the same position as when they left. This option only makes sense in a browser context that supports [PJAX-style] dynamic page loading (this includes most modern browsers).
`name` | The name of the page (copied from the `pages` key for convenience)

### Additional Options for List Pages

As noted above, "list" pages are typically backed by ORM models which in turn correspond to database tables.

 Name | Usage
------|-------
`form` | A representation of the model schema, in the form of an array of field definitions (see below)
`map` | Map configuration for the [wq/map.js] plugin.  See the [wq/map.js] documentation for more details.
`can_add`<br>`can_edit`<br>`can_delete` | Server-defined flags indicating which permissions the current user has on the model.  These flags are useful as [template rendering context] variables for showing and hiding available options to the user.  They are automatically computed and enforced by wq.db based on information from [django.contrib.auth].  They are not strictly enforced by wq/app.js since permissions are handled on the server side.
`per_page` | Default number of results that will be returned per page in paginated lists.  This can be overridden by the `limit` url argument.
`lookup` | Name of identifier column to use when looking up objects for detail views, and to use as the `id` attribute in serialized JSON data.  Defaults to `obj.pk`, except for `identified` models where the default is `obj.primary_identifier.slug`.  Enforced by wq.db; mostly invisible to wq.app.
`partial` | Indicates that the REST service is filtering results from the list view JSON payload (typically to conserve offline storage usage).  If `partial` is set to false or unset, wq/app.js will immediately return a faux 404 page if the user attempts to navigate to the detail view of an object not found in the local store.  If `partial` is true, wq/app.js will instead attempt to request the detail view as HTML directly from the server and display it if successful.
`reversed` | Indicates that the REST service orders results in reverse order (e.g. newest to oldest).  Used by [wq/app.js] to append newly saved items to the beginning of the cached list.
`max_local_pages` | Used for pagination control, to set a limit on how many paginated pages of list JSON to load and store locally when searching for an individual item.  Typically used with the `partial` option.
`postsave` | The name of the page to return to after saving a record, with an optional "mode" extension.  Available modes are the same as the [templates]: `_list`, `_detail`, and `_edit`.  The default `postsave` action is to return to the detail view of the newly saved item (i.e. `[pagename]_detail`).  If `postsave` is set to a parent of the current page (i.e. `[parentpage]_detail`), the foreign key will be consulted to determine which parent object to show.

### Form Fields

As of wq 1.0, the configuration object for each list page includes an [XLSForm]-inspired representation of the schema for the model.  This information can be used by the [wq maketemplates][wq.start] command to automatically generate a Mustache HTML `<form>` template for editing a page.  Certain properties are also used by wq/app.js to handle choice lookups and relationships between models (which are harder to bake into an HTML template).  The `form` configuration thus replaces the `parents`, `children`, and `choices` page configuration options available in [wq 0.8] and earlier.

The `form` attribute is an array of wq field definitions, which are JSON objects with any of the following attributes.  Where applicable, the corresponding concepts in the [XLSForm Question][XLSForm] and [Django Field][django-field] definitions are listed.

 wq Field | XLSForm Question | Django Field | Usage
----------|------------------|--------------|-------
`name` | `name` | `name`|  Internal name for the field
`type` | `type` | (derived from class) | XLSForm type (e.g. `int`, `string`, `select1`, `binary`.  The `group` and `repeat` types are used together with the `children` attribute (below).
`label` | `label` | `verbose_name` | User-friendly label for the field
`hint` | `hint` | `help_text` | Longer description of the field or how the user should populate it
`bind.required` | `bind.required` | (opposite of `null`) | Whether the field is required or optional.  The format `bind: {required: true}` is for compatibility with the XLSForm syntax.
`wq:length` | n/a | `max_length` | Maximum allowed length for `string` fields
`choices` | `choices` | (derived from `choices`) | An array of valid choices for enum-style fields on the model in the format `{'name': '(user-friendly name)', 'value': '(internal value)'}`.  This information is surfaced in the `[model_name]_edit` [template rendering context] as `[field_name]_choices`, with a `selected` flag set on the currently selected option when editing an existing record.
`wq:ForeignKey` | n/a | (derived from model name) | This is used by wq/app.js to automatically retreive a list of choices from the referenced model when rendering a form.  The list of potential parent records is surfaced in the `[model_name]_edit` [template rendering context] as `[field_name]_list`, with `id` and `label` attributes for each record in the parent model, and a `selected` flag set on the currently selected parent when editing an existing record.  Note that the referenced model should also be registered in the configuration object for all of this this to work.
`filter` | n/a | n/a | An optional filter to apply to the list of potential parent records referenced by a ForeignKey.  This is passed to [model.filter()][wq/model.js] on the parent model.
`children` | `children` | (c.f. `related_name` and inline formsets) | This defines a nested list of fields that represent sub-observations or a ["tall schema"][EAV] structure.  The structure is an array of fields in the same format as the top-level `form` array.  If the field type is `group`, the nested fields will be repeated once in the form.  If the field type is `repeat`, the fields can be repeated multiple times, with a button to add additional sub-observations.  The nested observations would normally be stored in an auxilary table with a `ForeignKey` pointing to this one.  The auxilary table does *not* need be registered with the configuration separately.
`initial` | n/a | n/a | Configuration for determining how to generate nested `repeat` observations when creating a "new" record. By default, no nested records will be displayed at first, but a button will be provided to add one or more nested records.  To simulate Django's default of 3 nested inline forms, set `initial` to "3".  To leverage an [EAV] structure (where each nested record corresponds to a row in a separate "Attribute" or "type" table), set `initial` to an object specifying the name of the type model and a filter (if any) to use with [model.filter()][wq/model.js] when generating the list, e.g. `{"type_model": "attribute", "filter": {"active": true}`.

> FIXME: The nested/repeat stuff is pretty advanced (it requires custom DRF serializers on the wq.db side) - it should probably be moved to the patterns docs.
