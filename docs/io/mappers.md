wq.io: Mappers
==============
[wq.io.mappers]

Rename field names and values if needed and optionally convert the dictionaries into other object types (such as a namedtuple).  On export, mappers convert the mapped object back into a simple dictionary and map the field names and values back to the format expected by the file.
